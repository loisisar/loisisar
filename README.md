### Some quotes I love

Live in the future, and build what's missing.<br>
-- *[How to get start up ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html), Paul Graham*
<br>
<br>
It’s almost as though you approached everything looking for ways it could be better, whatever it was. A part of you is always asking, “Why is something done this way? Is this the best way it can be done?” You have to be fundamentally skeptical about everything.<br>
-- *[The McKinsey Way](https://www.amazon.co.uk/McKinsey-Way-Techniques-Strategic-Consultants/dp/0070534489), Ethan M. Rasiel*
<br>
<br>
You can never understand one language until you understand at least two.<br>
-- *Geoffrey Willans*
