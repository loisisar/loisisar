            I guess being a nerd but forgot to choose stem degree can be really good.

            In some sense you grabbed those in-person skills in liberal art courses and business, experiences when you clean toilets in hotels, being a waitress and learnt the rules and etiquettes in hospitality industry,
            at the same time that scientific mindset of doing things with a system applied into everything you do. When they both come in life, you feel like living.
            <br>
            <br>
            Wait a minute, I was studying hospitality in <a href="https://www.must.edu.mo/en">Macau University of Science and Technology</a> (hereafter: MUST). Stats and Casino Mathematics were a must.
            But compare to actual mathematicians who read proofs and write proofs, it seemed lacking a bit of flavour. It was difficult to compare Hospitality program in Macau with Switzerlands or Cornell ones, but having the opportunity to play around with casinos and nightclubs were dope.

            It's kind of cool. You live like an interstellar-traveller in a mind-castle and travel between several worlds in your head. And somehow all the worlds are connected to each other with logic and philosophy.
            <br>
            <br>
            Especially if you pick up other hard core science skills after university and self-learn many things, the whole world become slightly fluid, in the sense that you can see so many things you could do. And everyone's complaint turned into opportunities.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some friends were surprised that how could I transit between different industries and got into different big name companies.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would give some credit to systematic thinking. But my high school obsession Steve Jobs and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/McKinsey-Way-Techniques-Strategic-Consultants/dp/0070534489">The Mckinsey Way</a> helps a lot too. One taught me about public speaking, and the other taught me how to decompose an industry in a week.

            <b>Curiosity also plays a big part.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            My first 'actual' job outside of working as a waitress and housekeeper was digital department in <a href="https://www.sands.com/">Las Vegas Sands</a>, at the beginning of it I was manually scraping social media engagement rate from company accounts and competitors, 
            but the guy sat next to me was a 30 something data scientist, 
            had Electrical Engineer from University of Monash, who self-learn programming and artificial intelligence. 
            One day I looked at the cryptic language on his screen and asked him, what is this? 
            How did you learn this? Where did you learn this?
            <br>
            <br>
            He opened his edx and Coursera accounts and showed me all his copmleted courses and said "This is how I spend my night after work and during the weekend."
            <br>
            <br>
            "How do you manage your personal life? Do you even have time for dating??", I asked with shocking face.
            <br>
            <br>
            "This is more interesting than dating.", he replied.
            <br>
            <br>
            Somehow I actually agree.
            <br>
            <br>
            Disappontingly I didn't started to learn programming in that job, because I got caught up with a new internship in <a href="https://www.page.com/home-page">Page Group</a>, where I witnessed how to be the best sales. 
            I was shadowing a manager and helping him recruiting CMO and Marketing Director for a lot of FTSE500 companies located in Shenzhen. 
            At the age of 28, he was billing millions for the company and part of the Platinum Club (A group of best sales in Page Group where everyone makes more than millions). 
            He refined my mental model of personnel. If The Mckinsey Way taught me how to look at an industry and a company with structure, 
            he somehow applied The Mckinsey Way's structure and use that in evaluating people and clients with clear structure. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the things he taught me which I remember until today, 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>"If you look at everyone around you as a co-founder for your future start up, your whole world will change."</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn't understand it, but as I grew older, I started to found the wisdom in his saying. Now he is running his own headhunting start up.
            <br>
            <br>
            My time in Page Group was an interesting experience. I'd come home everyday and wrote what I saw. I didn't think headhunting was a business can go anywhere big, neither IPO. Yet they did it in 90s. The formula behind it was the process and structure, which turned intangible human assets into tangible products. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I finished all the training in Page Group, don't think I was enjoying sales, although I knew how it works. It's time for my next adventure. 
            I soon got recruited to a hotel consultancy as a researcher. As a former hotelier but stopped my hospitality career because of injuries, I thought--hotel consultancy is the way moving forward.
            <br>
            <br>
            Intrigued by psychology and finance, I went to <a href="https://www.henley.ac.uk/">Henley Business School</a> to finish a MSc. in Behavioural Finance. 
            And I realised a lot of things in hospitality was applied psychology in real life, without the name of it.
