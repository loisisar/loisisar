                            ‘CrossFitter’ and ‘Entrepreneur’ are probably my least favourable word to be called — They both sound a bit wankerish in my opinion. But if you fall into the target customer segment of CrossFit, you will keep reading.

                            This is what I get from people who do specific sports. For the majority that doesn’t do CrossFit, CrossFitters are just in a cult without noticing — 
                            they can’t stop talking about CrossFit as if CrossFit is a full-time job. 
                            The constant hype you’d get from CrossFitter makes you want to stay away from them. 
                            Anyone who does a specific type of sports, whether bouldering, boxing, tracking, or rugby, might consider CrossFit a fake sport that you have no targets to hit nor a sense of competition and winning. 
                            You are in a group class but focusing on your own performance without team collaboration, and it might get you nowhere if you don’t look out for what others are doing. You guys do too much of everything, 
                            and the dilution of effort makes you good at nothing. 
                            It’s partially true and untrue. However, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/14/crossfit-extreme-controversial-addictive">‘Gymnastics meets Olympic Lifting’</a>, 
                            described by the Guardian — Crossfit is extreme, controversial — and addictive. 
                            So does running a business.
